# API

The **Relay API*** offers many ways to interact with the data in your Graphcool project. Different options exist to [make requests to the Relay API](!alias-thaiph8ung).

The foundation for the API are the **automatically generated CRUD-style operations** that are based on your [data schema](!alias-ahwoh2fohj). Additionally, **you can use [Schema Extensions](!alias-xohbu7uf2e) to enhance your GraphQL schema** with additional operations. There are three categories of available operations:

* [GraphQL Queries](!alias-oiviev0xi7) are used to fetch data.
* [GraphQL Mutations](!alias-vah0igucil) are used to modify data.
* [GraphQL Subscriptions](!alias-eih4eew7re) are used to get notified of data changes in realtime.

The Relay API offers an [error handling](!alias-looxoo7avo) concept as well.

> Note: The Relay API is conforming with the Relay specification. If you don't use Relay as a GraphQL client, check the [Simple API](!alias-heshoov3ai) instead. The two APIs don't differ too much in features, but mostly in usage.
