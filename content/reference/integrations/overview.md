# Integrations

Graphcool allows the integration with different external services using [Graphcool Functions](!alias-boo6uteemo).

## Custom Authentication

Custom authentication workflows can be built using [Schema Extensions](!alias-xohbu7uf2e). The [Graphcool Functions collection](https://github.com/graphcool-examples/functions/) contains a list of examples, but **you should be able to use schema extensions to integrate with pretty much any authentication method**.

## Full text search with Algolia

[Algolia](!alias-emaig4uiki) is a hosted Search API that delivers instant and relevant results. Using the Algolia integration, you can define Algolia search indices to automatically sync your model data to Algolia.
